## The Gameplay
The player controls the eponymous character through an enclosed maze. The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts that pursue Pac-Man. When Pac-Man eats all of the dots, the player wins. If Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, he will lose.
