## Gameplay
The gameplay of this Pacman game is very similar to the original arcade game. You play as Pacman, a yellow circle with a mouth that must eat all the pellets in a maze while avoiding the ghosts that chase him. If Pacman touches a ghost, the game ends. Pacman has only one life, so be careful! The game is won when Pacman eats all the pellets in the maze.

## Controls
Use the arrow keys to move Pacman around the maze.
